# Customer-SLA-Breach-Prediction-Revenue-Risk-Prioritization

## PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
### Each morning, the Support Operations Manager must decide which open customer support tickets to resolve first. Because support capacity is limited, resolving one ticket means delaying others. Some delays lead to SLA breaches and potential churn among high-value customers.
The goal is to prioritize today’s open tickets in a way that minimizes total revenue at risk, not simply the number of breached SLAs.
